# Performance-Evaluation-of-Programming-Languages-In-Data-Intensive-Applications
This performance evaluation (benchmark) is part of my Bachelor's thesis (Performance Evaluation of Programming Languages In Data-Intensive Applications: A Comparative Analysis Between Python, C++, Java, Go, Rust and Julia). This repository includes workspace folders used for testing each language (including test program files), CSV data files that were used and results of the evaluation. 

# Abstract

This study evaluates the performance of programming languages in data-intensive applica-tions. The significance of data and the benefits of its processing have grown substantially alongside the increasing opportunities for data collection. A deeper understanding of data envi-ronments facilitates more efficient operations, leading to heightened demands on applications and automation systems. Achieving robust performance amid growing data volumes is critical, and the choice of programming languages can significantly influence this outcome. This is a subject that has not been thoroughly researched, and this thesis aims to explore it.

The performance of programming languages was measured using test programs designed to execute operations typical in data-intensive applications. These programs processed three CSV files of varying sizes containing numerical values. The data from each file was loaded into memory, processed, and calculations were computed from it. Execution times for these tasks were recorded, yielding insights into each languageâ€™s performance characteristics. The evaluat-ed languages included Python, C++, Java, Go, Rust, and Julia.

Among these, C++, Go, and Rust demonstrated the fastest average execution times, with their test programs showing minimal additional strain as data volumes increased. Java also ex-hibited strong stable performance and increasingly better scalability with larger datasets. Python and Julia were the slowest overall, though Julia outperformed all other languages in computa-tional speed during the calculations.
